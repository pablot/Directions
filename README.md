# Directions
Stupid game in go (in terminal), where you got 3 seconds to remember directions. Then you need to write what you remembered.

## How to play

Download GO from www.golang.org

Using terminal put

<code> go get github.com/pablot/directions </code>

<code> go build github.com/pablot/directions </code> 

<code> directions </code>

# Have Fun ! :)
